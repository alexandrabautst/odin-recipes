    <p>CBeef & broccoli is an American dish consisting of pieces of flank steak that are stir-fried with broccoli and seasoned with a Chinese-style sauce made with oyster sauce, soy sauce, and cornstarch. The dish has Chinese influences, although it is not originally Chinese, but it is believed that the first versions of the dish were prepared by Chinese immigrants who had settled in San Francisco.</p>
